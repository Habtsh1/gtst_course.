      *Essemtial command binaries that need to be available in single-user mode;for all users 
      e.g cat,ls,cp,pwd
   3/boot-Boot loader files
      * krenel initrd,vmlinux.grubfiles are located under /boot 

   4 /dev - Essential Device files 
      * these include terminal device,usb or any device attached to the system
